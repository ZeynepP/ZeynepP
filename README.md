ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZeynepP



I am a research engineer. I have just moved to Canada and became a housewife thanks to IRCC. Anyway, that gives me some time to create this page, 
to update and clean my github repositories and to work on some new personal research projects ;) 
A small list of my interests :
<ul>
  <li>NLP
    <li>Deep Learning
    <li>Graph Neural Networks 
   <li>Social media studies (Twitter archiving and visualization etc.)
     <li> INformation diffusion, Fake news detection
     <li>(Temporal) Search result diversification / IR Web archiving
       <li> Neuroscience (personal level)
</ul>
